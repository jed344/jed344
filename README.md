- 👋 Hi, I’m @jed344
- 👀 I’m new to Github and am interested in learning more about coding, Web 3, and collaboration
- 🌱 I’m yet undecided what to learn but will turn my hand to anything. I have some knowledge and experience of html and css
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything but particularly web 3 and crypto projects
- 📫 How to reach me ... I imagine here? but also jedge11@protonmail.ch
- 😄 Pronouns: ... Male 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Being a rock music fan an unusual fact I came across recently was that Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi was once in prog folk rockers Jethro Tull!
